# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare tidy data that 
can be used for later analysis. The dataset used in this project was 
collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Files in the Repository
- `run_analysis.R`: The R script used to clean and process the data.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The final tidy dataset.
- `CodeBook.md`: A detailed description of the dataset and variables.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Use the Script
1. Download the dataset from
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the dataset and set the working directory in R to the location 
	of the unzipped data.
3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script in R.
4. The script will generate a tidy dataset (`tidy_data.txt`) and save 
	it in the working directory.

## Acknowledgments
- The dataset was provided by the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]
